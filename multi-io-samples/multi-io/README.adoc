Spring Cloud Stream Multi IO Sample
====================================

In this *Spring Cloud Stream* sample, the application shows how to configure multiple input/output channels inside a single application.

## Requirements

To run this sample, you will need to have installed:

* Java 8 or Above

## Code Tour

This sample is a Spring Boot application that bundles multiple application together to showcase how to configure multiple input/output channels.

* MultipleIOChannelsApplication - the Spring Boot Main Application
* SampleSource - the app that configures two output channels (output1 and output2).
* SampleSink - the app that configures two input channels (input1 and input2).

The channels output1 and input1 connect to the same destination (test1) on the broker (Kafka) and the channels output2 and
input2 connect to the same destination (test2) on Kafka.
For demo purpose, the apps `SampleSource` and `SampleSink` are bundled together.
In practice they are separate applications unless bundled together by the `AggregateApplicationBuilder`.

## Running the application

The following instructions assume that you are running Kafka as a Docker image.

* Go to the application root
* `docker-compose up -d`

* `./mvnw clean package`

* `java -jar target/multi-io-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

The application will log messages from source and sink.
Source sends a message every second which will be consumed by the sink.
You will see output similar to the following every second.

```
******************
From Source1
******************
Sending value: FromSource1
******************
From Source2
******************
Sending value: FromSource2
******************
At Sink2
******************
Received message FromSource2
******************
At Sink1
******************
Received message FromSource1
```

* `docker-compose down`

## Running the application using Rabbit binder

All the instructions above apply here also, but instead of running the default `docker-compose.yml`, use the command below to start a Rabbitmq cluser.

* `docker-compose -f docker-compose-rabbit.yml up -d`

* `./mvnw clean package -P rabbit-binder`

* `java -jar target/multi-io-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Once you are done testing: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-rabbit.yml down`

== What is this app?

This is an example of a Spring Cloud Stream processor using Kafka Streams aggregation support.

The application simply aggregates a string for a particular key.

=== Running the app:

Go to the root of the repository and do:

`docker-compose up -d`

`./mvnw clean package`

`java -jar target/kafka-streams-aggregate-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Run the stand-alone `Producers` application a few times to to generate some data.

Then go to the URL: http://localhost:8080/events
